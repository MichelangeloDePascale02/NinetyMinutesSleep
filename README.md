# NinetyMinutesSleep
A simple application to relax and set your alarms.

This application, which is very spartan at the moment, focuses on the so-called <i>90-minute rule</i>, according to which every hour and a half our sleep ends a <b>phase</b>. At the end of these phases it should be easier and less "painful" to wake up and start our day again.

The application allows you to program an alarm clock, which will then be managed <b>internally</b> by the application. It will play the alarm even if it is closed.
The user can set an Alarm, which will be kept in the app's memory until it is triggered. The programmed alarm can be canceled at any time. The user can also schedule multiple alarms and assign custom ringtones to each of them. To further personalize the experience, you can also change the cycle (which is set to 90 minutes by default), adapting it to your needs.

Another function already available is that relating to <b>sounds</b>: a series of sound effects can be produced which allow you to relax and, hopefully, induce sleep. Multiple sounds can be played <b>simultaneously</b> and a <b>sleep timer</b> can be set to prevent endless playback. In addition, each sound is adjustable in volume, to make the mix of noises unique and personal.

It also allows you to set a small timer for concentration, the so-called Pomodoro Timer, of variable length as desired.

Finally, it supports <b>Monet</b> theming engine!

Here are some screenshots to give an idea of ​​the current state of the application:
