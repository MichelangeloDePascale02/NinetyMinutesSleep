# NinetyMinutesSleep
A simple application to relax and set your alarms.

This application, which is very spartan at the moment, focuses on the so-called <i>90-minute rule</i>, according to which every hour and a half our sleep ends a <b>phase</b>. At the end of these phases it should be easier and less "painful" to wake up and start our day again.

The application allows you to program an alarm clock, which will then be managed <b>internally</b> by the application. It will play the alarm even if it is closed.

Another function already available is that relating to <b>sounds</b>: a series of sound effects can be produced which allow you to relax and, hopefully, induce sleep. Multiple sounds can be played <b>simultaneously</b> and a <b>sleep timer</b> can be set to prevent endless playback. In addition, each sound is adjustable in volume, further personalizing the experience.

Finally, it supports <b>Monet</b> theming engine!

Here are some screenshots to give an idea of ​​the current state of the application, in light and dark theme, on two different devices, one with custom ROM, the other with MIUI 14:
