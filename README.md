# NinetyMinutesSleep
A simple application to relax and set your alarms.

This application, which is very spartan at the moment, focuses on the so-called <i>90-minute rule</i>, according to which every hour and a half our sleep ends a <b>phase</b>. At the end of these phases it should be easier and less "painful" to wake up and start our day again.

Currently, the application allows you to set an alarm, following these "phases", then sending the user back to the system application for confirmation. In the future, the application will be able to manage alarm clocks <b>completely independently</b>, also allowing the addition of new functions and goodies.

Another function already available is that relating to <b>sounds</b>: a series of sound effects can be produced which allow you to relax and, hopefully, induce sleep. Multiple sounds can be played <b>simultaneously</b> and a <b>sleep timer</b> can be set to prevent endless playback.
